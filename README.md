This Task List app was used to practice HTML and JavaScript.

This application focuses on DOM manipulation.

I Learned about:

- Local Storage
- Conditionals
- JSON.parse/stringify
- using className to add a class
- using appendChild to add elements
- Creating elements with the DOM
- Event Listeners
- Click Events
- keyups
- DOMContentLoaded
- Submit
- Query Selectors
- Materialize CSS
